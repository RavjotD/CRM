"Hi Replit Core, I want to create a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for business owners to track customer leads. I need help setting up the project with the following requirements:

1. **Tech Stack**:
   - Frontend: React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling).
   - Backend: Express.js (Node.js).
   - Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data like leads, contacts, and tasks).
   - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user login.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - A `frontend` folder for the React app.
   - A `backend` folder for the Express.js server.
   - A `database` folder for PostgreSQL setup and migrations.

3. **Features**:
   - Lead management (create, read, update, delete leads).
   - Contact management (store and organize customer details).
   - Task management (assign tasks and reminders).
   - User authentication (signup, login, and secure routes).

4. **Scaling and Deployment**:
   - Use Replit’s built-in hosting for initial deployment.
   - Provide guidance on how to scale the project later (e.g., migrating to Vercel + Render).

5. **Development Environment**:
   - Set up a Replit workspace with all necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, Express).
   - Include a `.replit` file for configuring the workspace (e.g., run commands for frontend and backend).

6. **Database Setup**:
   - Provide a script to initialize the PostgreSQL database with tables for `users`, `leads`, `contacts`, and `tasks`.
   - Include an ORM like Sequelize for managing database interactions.

7. **API Endpoints**:
   - Create example API endpoints for CRUD operations on leads, contacts, and tasks.
   - Include authentication middleware for secure routes.

8. **Frontend UI**:
   - Create a basic React UI with a dashboard to display leads, contacts, and tasks.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a modern and responsive design.

9. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear instructions on how to run the project locally and deploy it using Replit’s hosting.
   - Include a README file with setup instructions and an overview of the project structure.

Please guide me step-by-step to set up this project in Replit Core, ensuring it’s configured for easy scaling and deployment. Thank you!"
